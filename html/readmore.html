				<h2>Importance of Fertilizers</h2>
				<p>It is very difficult to meet the demands of the increasing population with such fewer resources. Loss
					of soil fertility, pests, and lack of nutrients has resulted in a decrease in agricultural
					production. This has increased the importance of fertilizers in agriculture.

					Fertilizers can be important to the plants in the following ways:

					Fertilizers increase plants’ tolerance towards pests. This has reduced their reliance on
					insecticides and herbicides, thereby, producing healthier crops.<span id="dots">...</span><span
						id="more">Consequently, diseases have reduced, providing aesthetic value to the crops.

						Fertilizers improve the water holding capacity of the plants and increase root depth.

						The potassium content present in the fertilizers strengthens the straws and stalks of the
						plants.

						The phosphorus present in the fertilizers helps in the faster development of roots and formation
						of seeds in the plants.

						Nitrogen in the fertilizers enhances the growth of the plants which can be characterized by the
						green colour of the plants.

						Since the chemical fertilizers adversely affect soil fertility, biofertilizers were brought into
						use. These are substances that contain living or latent cells, and even micro-organisms. They
						provide the soil with the necessary nutrients and microbes for the growth of the plants. They
						help the soil to retain its fertility. They are environment-friendly and also destroy pathogenic
						components responsible for causing disease in plants. Acetobacter and Rhizobium are two such
						widely used biofertilizers.</span>

				<h2>Organic Fertilizer</h2>
				<h3>Molasses :</h3>
				<p>Molasses is the by-product of beating sugarcane, grapes or sugar beets into sugar. The dark, rich,
					and somewhat sweet liquid is commonly used as a sweetener in baked goods, as a natural remedy for
					many ailments, and added to animal feed. Even though it is a by-product, molasses is full of
					vitamins and minerals. As a result, molasses as fertilizer is possible too.Using molasses in organic
					gardening practices is nothing new. The sugar refinement process goes through three stages, each
					yielding a type of molasses product.<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> Blackstrap molasses
						is created from the third boiling of sugar in the refinement process. Blackstrap molasses is
						high in calcium, magnesium, iron and potassium. It also contains sulfur and a host of
						micronutrients. Using molasses as fertilizer provides plants with a quick source of energy and
						encourages the growth of beneficial microorganisms.Unsulphered blackstrap molasses is commonly
						added to organic fertilizers to give plants the necessary carbohydrates and trace minerals that
						they need to be healthy. Molasses can be added to organic liquid fertilizers, compost tea,
						alfalfa meal tea and kelp, to name a few.When molasses is added to organic fertilizers, it
						provides food for the healthy microbes in the soil. The greater amount of microbial activity in
						the soil, the healthier plants will be. Add molasses at a rate of 1 to 3 tablespoons (14-44 ml.)
						to 1 gallon (3.5 L.) of fertilizer for best results. Molasses can also be added to water and
						sprayed on plant leaves or poured on the soil. When the molasses is sprayed directly on plant
						leaves, the nutrients and sugar are absorbed quickly, and nutrients are immediately
						available</span>

				<h3>Legume :</h3>
				<p>The family of legumes is Leguminosae. Legumes are found in most areas of the world and are fast
					growing and inexpensive food crops. Domesticated legume crops have been in human cultivation for
					more than 5,000 years. Legumes encompass a wide range of edible nuts and vegetables. There are also
					legume plants that are not edible but have many of the same benefits for soil health. Legume pods
					easily break into two equal hemispheres, but<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> not all
						legumes produce pods. Some, such as clover and alfalfa, are edible forage for cattle and other
						herbivores.Legume pods are high in protein and have a low glycemic index. They substitute for
						animal fats in vegetarian diets and have low fat properties. Legumes are also a rich source of
						fiber. As a result, both pod and forage legumes have been in human cultivation for centuries.
						Farmers have long known that legume plants improve soil conditions. The range of legume plant
						forms includes vine types to creeping ground covers. All legumes are flowering and most have a
						flower that produces a thickened petal or keel that is formed by two petals that fuse together.
						5.1M951 Growing Jade HouseplantsBeans and peas are not the only legumes. Legume cover crops may
						be alfalfa, red clover, fava, vetch or cowpeas. They store nitrogen in nodules on the roots. The
						plant harvests nitrogen gas from the air and combines it with hydrogen. The process creates
						ammonia, which is converted by bacteria into nitrates, a usable form of nitrogen. Once the
						plants are tilled into the soil, they release the nitrogen into the earth as they compost. This
						improves the soil and provides supplemental nitrogen that was removed by other plant’s growth.
						Legume cover crops are valuable for the home gardener as well as the farmer. They also help
						prevent soil erosion and provide food for wildlife.The most popular legume plants are peas and
						beans. Pole or bush beans provide long slender pods, while peas may be shell or edible pods.
						Stringless varieties of beans are easier to eat and snow or sugar peas have such soft shells
						that the entire pea is delicious eaten whole. Some beans are meant to be shelled and the small
						ovaries inside dried. These are kidney, cranberry and black beans, among others. Outside of
						these popular legume plants, there are also other types of legumes. There are 18,000 species of
						plants in the family. The tipu tree, Moreton Bay chestnut, Acacia and Albizia are all forms of
						legumes from around the globe. Even the common peanut is a member of the legume family.</span>

				<h3>Kelp :</h3>
				<p>Kelp seaweed is a type of marine algae, brown in color and with a huge growth size. A product of our
					nutrient-rich oceans, kelp is often mixed with fish products and used as a fertilizer to encourage
					healthier plant growth, promote greater fruit and vegetable yields and to overall enhance the
					general appearance of a garden or plant specimen. Organic kelp fertilizer is valued for its
					micro-nutrients as well as its macro-nutrients of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Kelp
					fertilizer is available in three forms. These include extracts, such as kelp meal or powder, cold
					processed (usually a liquid) and<span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4"> enzymatically digested
						liquid forms, which are used to super power nutrient deficient soils.Organic kelp fertilizer is
						dried seaweed. Kelp seaweed has a cell structure that filters sea water looking for the oceans
						rich nutrients. Due to this constant filtration, the kelp plant grows at exorbitant rates,
						sometimes as much as up to 3 feet (91 cm.) a day. This rapid growth rate makes kelp a renewable
						and ample resource for not only many sea creatures but also as an organic fertilizer for the
						home gardener. The benefits of kelp are that it is a completely natural, organic product and a
						source of over 70 vitamins and minerals. For this reason, it is an important dietary supplement
						for many people as well as being a terrific organic fertilizer. Organic kelp fertilizer can be
						applied to any type of soil or plant without concern for waste by-products or harmful chemicals,
						leading to healthier crop yields and general plant well being.The nitrate-phosphate-potassium
						ratio, or NPK, is negligible in readings of kelp meal nutrients; and for this reason, it is used
						primarily as a trace mineral source. Combining with fish meal increases the NPK ratio in kelp
						meal nutrients, releasing in about 4 months time. Kelp powder is simply kelp meal ground finely
						enough to put into a solution and sprayed onto or injected into irrigation systems. Its NPK
						ratio is 1-0-4 and is more immediately released. Kelp meal nutrients can also be found in liquid
						kelp, which a cold processed liquid with higher levels of growth hormones, but again its NPK is
						negligible. Liquid kelp is useful for combating plant stress.Kelp meal fertilizer can be
						purchased at your local garden center or online. To use kelp meal fertilizer, spread the kelp
						meal around the base of plants, shrubs and flowers that you wish to fertilize. This fertilizer
						can be utilized as a potting plant medium or mixed directly into the soil.</span></p>

				<h3>Compost Tea</h3>
				<p>While there are several recipes available for making compost tea, there are only two basic methods
					that are used—passive and aerated. Passive compost tea is the most common and simplistic. This
					method involves soaking compost-filled “tea bags” in water for a couple of weeks. The ‘tea’ is then
					used as a liquid fertilizer for plants. Aerated compost tea requires additional ingredients like
					kelp, fish hydrolysate, and humic acid. This method also requires the use of air<span
						id="dots5">...</span><span id="more5"> and/or water pumps, making it more costly to prepare.
						However, using this compost tea starter takes less brewing time and is often ready for
						application within a few days as opposed to weeks.As with the majority of recipes for making
						compost tea, a 5:1 ratio of water to compost is used. It takes about five parts water to one
						part compost. Preferably, the water should not consist of chlorine. In fact, rainwater would be
						even better. Chlorinated water should be allowed to sit at least 24 hours beforehand. The
						compost is placed in a burlap sack and suspended in a 5-gallon bucket or tub of water. This is
						then allowed to “steep” for a couple of weeks, stirring once every day or two. Once the brewing
						period is complete the bag can be removed and the liquid can be applied to plants.Depending on
						the size and type of system, commercial brewers are also available, especially for aerated
						compost tea. However, you have the option of building your own, which can be much more cost
						effective. A makeshift system can be put together using a 5-gallon fish tank or bucket, pump and
						tubing Compost can be added straight to the water and strained later or placed in a small burlap
						sack or pantyhose. The liquid should be stirred a couple times each day over a two to three day
						period.</span></p>
