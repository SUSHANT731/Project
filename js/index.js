        content:
          "Introduction: Botrytis leaf blight, often termed blast, is a foliar disease common to onion growing regions in eastern and midwestern states. The disease causes leaf spotting and tip dieback, and can adversely affect the maturity and quality of the bulbs.Symptoms -: Botrytis infection initially results in small, leaves. These lesions often are surrounded by a halo of green water-soaked tissue. Leaf tissue within the spots eventually collapses and becomes tan colored. Numerous lesions on a single leaf result in dieback of the entire onion top, giving severely affected fields a `blasted' apperence  Disease Cycle :- Blast is caused by Botrytis squamosa, a fungus that overwinters with infected crop debris and in onion cull piles. These inoculum sources produce spores in late spring and summer that are wind-dispersed to other plants and fields. Cool summer temperatures (55-75 F) and long periods of leaf surface wetness provide optimum environmental conditions for rapid leaf blighting. Leaves of older plants are more susceptible to blast infection than are the younger plants.  Disease Control :- Destruction of cull piles and rotation out of onions for at least 2-3 years are important to help prevent the buildup of inoculum and reduce the likelihood of severe epidemics. Because these cultural practices are only partially effective, and no blast-resistant varieties are available, onion growers must rely upon repeated application of protective fungicides for acceptable disease control. Some farmers in Michigan use a weather-based computer program to schedule fungicide applications, thereby eliminating unnecessary sprays",

        content:
          "Introduction :- Purple blotch is a disease of onion and related crops caused by Alternaria porri, a fungus affecting tops and bulbs. The disease is prevalent throughout the onion growing regions of the Midwest. Yield losses attributed to Alernaria purple blotch are reported to approach 25%. Symptoms :- Symptoms first appear as small tan spots on leaves. The lesions become sunken and rapidly expand rapidly up and down the leaf. Individual lesions 1/4 diameter frequently are surrounded by a band of purple tissue. Numerous leaf lesions contribute to collapse of the entire top. Wounds occurring at or shortly before harvest provide sites for Alternaria infection of onion bulbs.Disease Cycle :- The pathogen survives midwestern winters on infected crop debris. Spores are produced on the debris as warm, wet conditions occur in the spring. Wind and rain are responsible for dispersing spores to other plants and fields. Tops are more prone to infection as plants mature. Under favorable conditions, an unprotected crop can sustain a substantial amount of infection in a few weeks. Disease Control :- Crop rotation is important to prevent pathogen populations from building up to high levels. Rotations out of onions for 2-3 years are recommended. Most commercial onion crops must be protected from purple blotch by using repeated applications of protective fungicides",

          "Introduction :-The pathogen is a fungus (Peronospora destructor) that survives in Indiana fields. Early-season epidemics have resulted in severe yield losses. Symptoms :- Downy mildew is identified by a purple-brown mold occurring in irregular shaped patches on onion leaves. The mold represents thousands of spores produced by the fungus in wet or humid weather. Severely affected leaves collapse and die in a few days. Disease Cycle :- The downy mildew pathogen overwinters in infected crop residue and in soil as resistant spore-structures. It is also possible for the pathogen to be carried with the seed. During the growing season, the disease is spread by wind-dispersed spores which have been produced in cool-wet weather. Infection and spore production will continue throughout spring and early summer as long as favorable conditions persist. Disease Control :- Crop rotation and the use of disease-free seed are important in preventing severe, early-season epidemics. In growing regions where downy mildew is an annual threat to production, farmers rely on fungicides to reduce losses caused by mildew. Protective fungicides provide a moderate degree of control. If downy mildew is already established in a field, a systemic fungicide can be used to eradicate existing infections",},

          "Disease Cycle. Common bunt and stinking smut are most commonly seed-borne diseases, but they can be soilborne and wind-borne as well. Seeds become contaminated during harvest, when smut spores from diseased plants stick to healthy kernels. Smut spores can survive in the soil for at least ten years, and seeds and young seedlings also may become infected when they are sown near these spores (soilborne). Smut spores and wheat seeds germinate at the same time, allowing the fungus to penetrate the seed before seedling emergence. The fungus continues to grow in its host until it has invaded the head and developing ovaries. The healthy plant tissue is replaced by the fungus, and the kernels are converted into spores by the time the plant reaches maturity. Hosts include wheat, rye, triticale, barley, and grassy weeds. These diseases are favored by cool, moist soil conditions (40-60°F or 4-16°C), so they are more prevalent and severe in fall sown wheat than in spring-sown wheat. Symptoms. The symptoms of commn bunt and stinking smut generally are not apparent until heading. Diseased plants may be stunted, and bunted heads may be a darker color of green and may stay green longer than normal plants (Figure 9.1 a & b). Heads of infected plants may also be smaller and their numbers reduced. After heading, diseased heads can appear slightly open due to the expansion of infected kernels causing the glumes to spread apart. In infected heads, diseased kernels, or bunt balls (Figure 9.2), are dull, grayish-brown in color and are filled with dark brown spore masses. The heads rupture at harvest and release spores that have a fishy odor due to the chemical trimethylamine. Management.

        content:
          " Symptoms Ergot is a disease of pearl millet grain-bearing heads (inflorescences). The first sign of ergot infection in pearl millet is the appearance of viscous creamy-pink exudations, called honeydew on the flowering heads. Subsequently hard brown spiky structures are formed, called sclerotia. Cause Fungus Comments Ergot reduces grain yields and constitutes a health hazard to humans and animals that consume pearl millet products contaminated with the alkaloid-containing sclerotia of the causal fungus. It is a particularly serious disease of pearl millet F1 hybrids. Biology and Epidemiology: Infection of the individual florets on a pearl millet inflorescence occurs via the stigmas, i.e. the white feathery structures through which the florets are fertilised following pollination. Initial infection is from spores (ascospores) produced from sclerotia in the soil or in crop debris. Secondary infection is from the spores (conidia) produced in the honeydew. Once the stigmas have been pollinated they rapidly wither and are no longer available as the infection route for the ergot fungus. Pearl millet plants are protogynous, with the stigmas emerging before the anthers. Pearl millet F1 hybrids demonstrate synchronous flowering, so that most of the inflorescences in a crop will be at the protogynous stage with little or no pollen available, which makes F1 hybrids particularly vulnerable to ergot infection. Heavy rain at flowering time washes down pollen, extending the period at which the stigmas are available for infection as well as providing ideal conditions for germination and sporulation of the ergot fungus. Management Ergot can be managed in pearl millet, through the use of host plant resistance, pollen management, avoidance and sanitation. Host plant resistance to ergot can be developed using appropriate inoculation, hybridisation and selection techniques. Sources of host plant resistance are developed and made available by public- and private-sector seed companies. It has been shown in research station experiments that using pollen donor plants to coincide with the protogynous stage of crop flowering can significantly reduce infection in ergot susceptible pearl millet F1 hybrids. Avoidance of ergot is achieved through the selection of cultivars that flower during periods of fine dry weather, so that pollen wash and pathogen germination are minimised. Sanitation measures involve the removal and burning of infected inflorescences as soon ergot symptoms are seen. When this is done at the honeydew stage it will reduce secondary spread within the crop. When done at the sclerotial stage it will reduce the inoculum bank for intions in subsequent seasons and reduce the dangers of consumption of the the poisonous alkaloids getting into food and feed products",

          "Symptoms The earliest symptoms are chlorosis at the base of a leaf, with subsequent leaves on the plant becoming more and more chlorotic, with the chlorosis always extending from the bases towards the tips of the leaves. The underside of chlorotic leaves develop white powdery or downy growth of sporangia and the spores that they bear. There is a distinct margin between diseased leaf tissue at base of leaf and healthy tissue towards tip. Inflorescences of infected tillers develop the characteristic green-ear symptoms where the grain is replaced by whip-like vegetative structures. Inflorescences can be partially or fully converted to green-ear, depending on the time in inflorescence development at which the infection occurred. Partial green-ear always begins at the base of the inflorescence. Plants infected at an early stage of development, before tillering begins can be killed. Cause Oomycete Comments Serious disease in Africa and India, occurs wherever millet is grown. Management The disease is systemic with the pathogen infecting the growing point of each tiller as the leaf and panicle tissues are being formed. Primary infection is from oospores which are long-lived in the soil. Secondary infection is from the spores produced by the sporangia on the undersides of infected leaves. Oospores are formed in necrotic infected plant material, which then contribute to the inoculum bank in the soil. To reduce infection rogue infected plants when found in the field; treat seeds with an appropriate systemic fungicide prior to planting and continue to spray the crop at least once every 25 days after sowing. Seed treatment Pearl millet downy mildew can be effectively controlled through the use of metalaxyl-based fungicide seed treatments. Application rates as low as 2 g a.i. per kg seed, using specially formulated seed-treatment products, can provide complete control of downy mildew even with highly susceptible hybrids. There is no value of subsequent foliar fungicide sprays following effective seed treatment. On-farm sanitation and selection In situations where resistant cultivars and seed treatments are not available, farming communities can reduce the incidence of downy mildew in pearl millet by on-farm sanitation practices and the selection of seed from robust downy mildew-free plants. Secondary spread of downy mildew within a crop is caused by the spores produced on diseased leaves, so removal of diseased plants or tillers at the first sign of disease should minimise secondary spread. Removal of diseased plants prior to inflorescence emergence, combined with selection of seed for the next season’s sowing from robust, downy mildew-free plants, should also reduce the level of susceptibility in the local cultivar gene pool developing a population of locally DM-resistant cultivars. Sanitation and selection will be more effective if done on a community basis rather than by individual farmers acting alone. The basis for effective on-farm actions is for farmers to fully understand the cause and epidemiology of the disease. Host Plant Resistance Pearl millet downy mildew is best managed by the use of resistant cultivars. Much has been learnt and done in the last 30 years to identify and utilise host plant resistance to this disease, through research done by ICRISAT in collaboration with National Agricultural Research Services (NARS) in India and other countries. In India, the existence of a strong and effective national agricultural research system together with effective public- and private-sector seed companies, has enabled the development and dissemination of a succession of cultivars and hybrids that have a high degree of resistance to downy mildew. The pathogen, however, is variable in its pathogenicity, so that cultivars or hybrids resistant to downy mildew in one region may not be resistant elsewhere. The greatest range of pathogenicity occurs in the Sahel zone of Africa, where the host and pathogen have co-evolved over a long period. Pearl millet hybrids developed for resistance to downy mildew in India have been highly susceptible when grown in the Sahel. Through the ICRISAT-NARS cooperative International Pearl Millet Downy Mildew Nursery program, sources of resistance have been identified that are effective throughout India and right across the African Sahel",
